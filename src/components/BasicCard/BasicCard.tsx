              Through personal projects and professional experiences, I have
              <b>
                designed mockups, built responsive UIs, implemented
                accessibility and Unit/E2E testings
              </b>
              .
              <br />
              <br />
              The biggest challenge and takeaway I have faced was definitely
              scaling and technical trade-offs. For instance, the focus on
              shipping meant things like performance optimisation would not be
              as optimal (e.g. Excessive API calls or relying on email dead
              letter queues - <i>ask me more bout it if you want to know ü´†</i>),
              so that became a point for future state as there was more focus on
              shipping it asap.
              <br />
              <br />
              These are also some of the tech stack that I have worked with. I
              would say I am familiar with most of your tech stack.
